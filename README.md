# Motivation & Aim
Ninja Van has been facing a long=term manpower issue for the NinjaBot chatbot, where they do not have sufficient live agents to manage high enquiry volumes. The waiting time for consumers to address their queries, however, is a critical aspect in the consumer experience. Identifying the importance of this issue, our team decided to target the manpower issue for the chatbot, through the implementation of new call-to-action features, and the use of a NLP model to enhance the automated chabot system.
In doing so, we seek to reduce the workload & reliance on live agents, and address consumers' queries promptly.

# Features
**Implementation of the Reschedule Call-To-Action Feature**
* Our team has identified the delivery reschedule function has largely been a manual process for Ninjachat, where it can only be performed by speaking to a live agent.
* Therefore, our team has implemented the feature in a convenient call-to-action button format, where users can easily update their preferred delivery time for a small fee
* Integrated into the existing automated chatpot options to maintain a consistent user interface and design


Target audience: Cosignees who use ninjachat

Problem: Wait time for live agents is too long

Solution: Implement more self-help features so that the wait time is reduced, increasing customer satisfaction

Features to implement in the chatbot:
- Rescheduling date of delivery
- Implement /end button to cancel live agent chat
- More to come...
